# Todo List App

A sleek and intuitive To-Do List application built with React and TypeScript, featuring dark mode, task prioritization, due dates, filtering, and sorting.

This is version 2 of the app â€” the original was developed months ago using vanilla JavaScript. Back then, I outlined several improvements I wanted to make. This version brings those ideas to life, rebuilt entirely with React and TypeScript for better structure, scalability, and a richer user experience.
